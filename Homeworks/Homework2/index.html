                <h2>STUSSY FALL LOOKBOOK</h2>
                <p>For Fall '23, Stüssy presents a collection of enigmatic staples alongside seasonal mainstays. 
                The collection experiments with proportions, technical elements, and iconic visuals. 
                This unconventional approach to the familiar brings together python- patterned pants, 
                pigment-dyed sweaters, recycled GORE-TEX® shells, and mohair club jackets, 
                blurring the lines between novelty and daily wear.

                <h2>STUSSY x LEVI'S</h2>
                <p>Stüssy & Levi’s® announced today the launch of their latest collaborative collection, set for Spring/Summer 2023. 
                The beloved brands have shared roots in California – Stüssy was born from the Southern California surf scene 
                in the late ’80s and early ’90s while Levi’s® was founded in San Francisco 170 years ago. 
                2023 marks the 150th anniversary of Levi’s® 501® Jeans, one of the most enduring icons of global style. 
                The range from Stüssy & Levi’s® features a pair of 501® Jeans and a modified Type II Trucker Jacket – two classic Levi’s® silhouettes 
                reimagined with Stüssy’s signature design aesthetic.

                <p>Back for another round, Stüssy adds its signature to the Nike Air Penny II. 
                Coming in two distinct colorways, a tonal fossil, and a rattan, black, and blue. 
                The collaborative touches return with Stüssy branding on the upper and outsole. 
                In addition, an apparel capsule collection complements the footwear. 
                Co-branded NRG cotton sweatpants come in blue, grey, and black and feature contrasting co-branding on the thigh, 
                are lined with fleece, and have elasticated trims. The wool pinstripe hooded zip-up jacket with matching pants, 
                socks, a graphic heavy knit sweater and t-shirt round out the offering.
