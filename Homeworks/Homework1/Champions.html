        <h3>Max Verstappen</h3>
        <p>Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to the limit. <br>
            The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive racing style. <br>
            F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. <br>
            A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming. <br>
            Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. <br>
            But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the victories <br>
            have kept on coming. They culminated in his first F1 drivers’ crown after that already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. <br>
            And he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, winning a record 15 races across the season.

        <h3>Lewis Hamilton</h3>
        <p>‘Still I Rise’ – these are the words emblazoned across the back of Lewis Hamilton’s helmet and tattooed across his shoulders, <br>
            and ever since annihilating expectations with one of the greatest rookie performances in F1 history in 2007, that’s literally all he’s done: risen to the top of the all-time <br>
            pole positions list ahead of his hero Ayrton Senna, surged into first place in the wins column surpassing the inimitable Michael Schumacher, and then <br>
            matched the legendary German’s seven world titles. Is he the G.O.A.T? Few would deny that he’s in the conversation – and what’s more he’s got there his way, <br>
            twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to stereotypes for how a racing driver should think, dress or behave. <br>
            Respect is hard earned in F1, but Hamilton – now Sir Lewis Hamilton to be precise – has it from every one of his peers. <br>
            Why? Because they know that whatever the track, whatever the conditions, whatever the situation, when his visor goes down and the lights go out, it’s Hammertime.

        <h3>Sebastian Vettel</h3>
        <p>
            The youngest ever world champion's accumulation of age-related records that began in 2010 continued for four consecutive seasons, <br>
            culminating in a one-sided 2013 title triumph that confirmed his status as one of the sport’s all-time greats. Sebastian Vettel’s first championship, <br>
            at the age of 23, provided a surprise ending to an intensely competitive 2010 campaign. There was surely more to come from this fast rising racer,<br>
            and it came quickly when he completely dominated in 2011 to become the youngest double world champion. In 2012, with a series of comebacks from setbacks <br>
            against the strongest opposition in the longest ever season, his third driving title in a row was hard-earned and well-deserved. In 2013, and still just 26 years old, <br>
            he made short work of becoming the youngest ever quadruple world champion. In truth the precocious youngster who came so far so fast was in a hurry from the time he was a toddler...
